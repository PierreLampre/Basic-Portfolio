# Basic-Portfolio
This is the first homework assignment for the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp.

I was tasked with making my own version of a basic portfolio site based
off of screenshots of a basic portfolio site made by the instructor. It is a three page site with an "About Me" containing text content and an image of me, a "Portfolio" containing pictures with links, and a "Contact" page with a form.  It is only designed to be the front end. of the pages. I was also encouraged to utilize hover features on links and make a sticky footer as bonus/extra instructions.

Also pictured in the About Me image is my cat, Simba.
